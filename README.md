# Computer-Vision
**Computer Vision Projects Repository Description**

Welcome to my GitHub repository for computer vision projects! Here, I present three projects that showcase the application of vision intelligence and machine learning in different domains. Each project addresses a unique problem statement and utilizes distinct datasets and techniques. Below is an overview of each project:

**Project 1**
- **Problem Statement:** The Indian government aims to enhance border security using unmanned drones. A model is needed to detect objects from images captured by these drones.
- **Dataset:** A corpus of images containing the following objects: 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'.
- **Expectation:** Create a model to detect the given objects. Students are guided with a logical flow at the beginning of the workbook, but they are encouraged to further modify it based on rubrics to maximize marks.

**Project 2**
- **Problem Statement:** The World Health Organization (WHO) needs to automate the process of reading X-rays to differentiate between COVID-19, viral fever, and normal health.
- **Dataset:** Downloaded from Kaggle (link provided in description).
- **Expectation:** Train a model to differentiate between COVID-19, viral fever, and normal health.

**Project 3**
- **Problem Statement:** Classify images as either containing a cat or a dog.
- **Expectation:** Build a model to distinguish between images with cats and dogs.

The repository will be structured with separate folders for each project containing:
- A Jupyter Notebook for the project
- The dataset used
- Any auxiliary files required for execution
